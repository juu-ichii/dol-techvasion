Techvasion - Planned to have a series of expansions/new stuff surrounded by technology (use of social media, computer, hacking, etc);

But let's not get too ambiguous first. I'll start with something here and will slowly expand. It's going to take a long time but I'll try to stay motivated as long as I could;
Here are something to note at:
- English is not my first language so you'll see some English that wasn't make any sense. Feel free to correct me.
- I just started to look into DoL (vanilla version) code and also trying to understand Twine Sugarcube syntax, but I believed I'll get used to it eventually. So bear with it until then.

Pre-requisite(s):-
- Modloader

Plan(s):-
> Vulpe Hotel - WIP - I've ported Flats (events and stuff from the vanilla DoL) as the base for Hotel then is planned to expand the events slowly;
Found this idea from the idea-suggestion under the DoL official server. The foundation of the Vulpe Hotel is using what we have from Vanilla Game (Flats) as a base, so there is a high chance that you'll see the events from Flats.

I'm still working on modifying those base events to better suit the Hotel theme we're having here so stay tuned.

Vulpe Hotel is located at Starfish Street. 

The content available now are:-
Hotel Rooms - WIP (planned on changing text/events to better suit our theme; adding new events (feel free to share your ideas)
Room 211 - will be more of a core here (for promiscuity activity) now we're separating into New customers (comes with 3 base events) and Regulars (WIP, coming soon)
Manager's room - no idea as of now; feel free to share your thoughts

> Smart devices - Planned, next focus after Vulpe Hotel is looking good (planned to start after 1.0 release)

> Streaming (New events, NPC, techs) - Planned

> Acting (Promiscuity, Professional, etc..) - Planned
